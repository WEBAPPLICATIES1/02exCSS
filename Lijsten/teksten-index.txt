personal lists
practical lists
dreamlists

Don't we all love lists... 
They exist in all kinds of types; we devided them into three main sections: personal lists, practical lists and at last of course our dreamlists!

Personal lists maybe are the most familar lists, we already made them since we were a child. They consider personal matter, such as your favorite artists, shows, ...

When you have a busy schedule practical lists will help you out. What to do before the concert, how to get there: it makes sense to organise these plans.

And last but not least, there are our dreamlists! What artists do you still want to see live, what concerts / festivals would you like to visit in your lifetime!
